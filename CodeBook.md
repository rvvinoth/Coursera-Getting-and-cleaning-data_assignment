This file explains the required input and expected output when running the run_analysis.R script.

Notice: The dataset and input, output are in the same R working environment.

Input

Here is the data used in this analysis:

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

After unzipping the data, we have a folder called UCI HAR Dataset and we will only need the following files:

features.txt: list of names of features activity_labels.txt: class labels with their activity name train/subject_train.txt: subjects in training dataset train/X_train.txt: training set data train/y_train.txt: training set labels test/subject_test.txt: subjects in test dataset test/X_test.txt: test set data test/y_test.txt: test set labels Output

The required tidy dataset tidy_data.txt is generated, with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Variables

The variables in the tidy dataset include:

activityName: contain the activity names.

Activity ID Activity Name 1 WALKING 2 WALKING_UPSTAIRS 3 WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS 4 SITTING 5 STANDING 6 LAYING subjectID: contain the subject IDs.

variables in the 3rd to 81th column, which are extracted from the features_info.txt file on the original dataset.

Description of analysis process:

For step 1 to step 4, create create.dataset function with argument data.name which can be either 'test' or 'train'. The function merges the features, activitiy labels, subject IDs from .txt files and uses grep function to extract only measurements of means and standard deviations. Then create trainging and test datasets, and merge them into one tidy dataset. In step 5, use functions in reshape2 package to calculate the average of each variable for each activity. The result is written into TidyData.txt.
